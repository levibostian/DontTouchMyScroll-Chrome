# DontTouchMyScroll-Chrome
Chrome extension to make every website have normal scrolling behavior. Stop messing with my scroll!

# Why?

Image this. You are browsing the web and you come up to a brand new website you have never been to before. You are greeted with this magnificent header image and some sexy typography. The webpage so far looks like a lot of fun to view.

Then, you decide to scroll down to view more of the site. You take your two fingers on your touch pad (or finger on your mouse wheel) and begin to scroll down. Because this is not your first rodeo scrolling a web page, you move your fingers at the same speed that you always move your fingers while viewing a website. You expect the web page to scroll down a few hundred pixels or so. Just enough to reveal the new content below.

...wait...WHAT?!?!? What is going on here!? Why is this website scrolling on it's own? Why is this website scrolling really fast for me? Why is this website scrolling really slow? Or even worse, why does it take extra work on my part to start scrolling, but then it goes fast as I continue to scroll?

You are now frustrated. You just want to view a web page but the web developer of this website has messed with your scroll behavior and is trying to manage the way you view this web page. You are not impressed and do not appreciate someone taking control of your fingers like this. You decide to do something about it. You decide to build a Chrome Extension to disable crazy scrolling behaviors.

# BIG thanks.

I still consider myself a beginner to web development and when I wanted to take on this task of creating a Chrome Extension to block scrolling behavior, I didn't know exactly how to do it. [I found this Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/chromeos/comments/3wb5gp/please_help_me_how_can_i_disable_the_forced/) which lead me to [this gist](https://gist.github.com/oxguy3/ebd9fe692518c7f7a1e9#file-roughscroll-js) which solves the problem for me. It helped me learn AND get rid of my annoyance with websites that mess with my scroll! Thanks!!!
